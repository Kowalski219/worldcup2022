    "In the 2022 World Cup, Argentina clinched the championship with an impressive performance. They achieved a total of six wins, but it's important to note that out of these six wins, only four were secured in regular 90-minute play. Argentina faced two draws during the tournament—one in the quarter-final and another in the final, both of which were eventually decided in Argentina's favor through penalty shootouts after extra time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we compare Argentina's performance to previous World Cup winners, we find that their four wins in regular 90-minute play align closely with the performances of past champions. Several previous winners, including France in 2018, Germany in 2014, Brazil in 2002, and Italy in 2006, also achieved six wins in their respective tournaments, with most of their victories coming in regular play.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the fact that Argentina had to rely on penalty shootouts to secure two crucial victories in the knockout stages—once in the quarter-final and then again in the final—sets their path to glory apart from some other winners. For instance, teams like Brazil in 1970 and Germany in 1974 managed to secure the championship with flawless records in regular play, with no losses or draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Argentina's journey to winning the 2022 World Cup featured four wins in regular 90-minute play and two wins decided by penalty shootouts in crucial matches. While their path to victory is undoubtedly commendable, it's important to consider the context and nuances of each tournament when making comparisons to previous champions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the analysis of Argentina's path to glory in the 2022 World Cup compared to previous winners, it's worth noting that draws in the knockout stages, followed by wins in penalty shootouts, have not been considered as draws. This means that if a team draws a match in the round of 16 (or any knockout stage) and subsequently wins it in a penalty shootout, it is counted as a win, similar to Argentina's performance in the quarter-final and final of the 2022 tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures consistency in assessing the performance of teams that faced penalty shootouts as part of their victorious journey in the World Cup. It acknowledges that winning a match on penalties is a legitimate path to victory in the knockout stages, and thus, these matches are considered as wins rather than draws or losses in this analysis.\n",
